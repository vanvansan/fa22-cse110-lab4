1. it prints out price.length - 1. Because var can be access in this scope.

2. the discounted price of the last price. Because it is right after the loop and var is global

3. the final price of last price, because var is global.

4. A list of var representing the final prices.

5. there will be an error because i is let and is declared in the for loop.

6. there will be an error because discountedPrice is let and is declared in the for loop.

7. last final price will be printed, because let is in that scope and finalprice last changed the last iteration in the loop. 

8. a list of final price will be returned. the loop pushed every final price to discouted

9. there will be an error because `i` is declared in the for loop.

10. it will return the length of price, because `length` is declared in this scope.

11. there will be an error because const type cannot be reassigned.

12. 
```
A. student.name
B. student['Grad Year']
C. student.greeting()
D. student['favorite teacher'].name
E. student
```

13. 

```
A. '32' , since int maps to str
B. 1 , numeric conversion
C. 3, null is 0
D. '3null', null converted to str
E. 4, true is 1
F. 0, false and null are 0
G. '3undefined', undefined converted to str
H. NaN, by arithmatic, converted to number first, undefined is NaN in number

```

14. 
```
A. True, 2 < 1 in number
B. False,  alphabetical 2 > 1
C. True, '2' = 2 in number
D. False, they are in different type
E. false, true = 1 in number
F. true, boolean(2) is true
```

15. A strict equality operator === checks the equality without type conversion. For a non-strict check ==, it checks the equality after doing type conversion.

17. result will be [2,4,6]. doSomething is passed to modifyArray as callback function. And in the for loop, every element in array is doubled as doSomething does.
